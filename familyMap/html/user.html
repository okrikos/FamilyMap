Well, you need to have some information about your relatives first. No, we do not provide a search engine for genealogy searches. 
We suggest that you start with the people around you whom you can remember of the top of your head. If successful, you can add
members of your extended family at a later point.

Next step is to organize your data into a sort of database. Yes, of course, you would like keep it on your PC. 
There is plenty of <A HREF="http://dir.yahoo.com/Arts/Humanities/History/Genealogy/GEDCOM/">software</A> that will
help you do that, some of it free, some rather 
inexpensive.  I personally recommend an excellent package Brother's Keeper for Windows, that can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.bkwin.com">http://www.bkwin.com</A> for free. You can do a lot with it, and the amount of genealogical information 
that is considered to be "valuable" is really great. You do not need Family Map Viewer to see the data on your PC, because 
Brother's Keeper has plenty of internal reports and data presentations.

<LI><a name="export"><h3>Export</h3>
When you decide to share your findings on the "family intranet", you should export the data from proprietary formats into a GED file.
<A HREF="http://user.it.uu.se/~andersa/gedcom/">GEDCOM standard</A> allows applications to exchange genealogical information.  On  
Brother's Keeper for Windows it can be done by clicking on File > Gedcom > Export. Save the file somewhere on your hard-drive.

We are not using cookies, POST form and commercial advertisement,
so anyone who follows the URL will see exactly the same Family Map as you do. If you are sending the Family Map to someone who 
is on the map, you probably want to start with him/her as a key.
