<li>
<b>Can I print the Family Map?</b><br/>
Not realy. The problem is that most of the browsers badly suited for
printing wide web page, produced by Family Map. Multiple overlaping branches 
are rendered not so good during printing. Of course you can
print a small map, when it all fit into on page in the row (use of landscape
page setup comes handy), but to be honest, for the such a small maps, 
regular genealogical software gives better result, anyway.

<LI>
<B>Is it running under Netscape 4?</B><BR>
No, it does not work under Netscape 4.*. It does not work under Opera either. 
Unlike the rest of the <a href="http://www.tyoma.com">www.tyoma.com</a> web site,
it designed to run under Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 or Gecko browsers 
(Firefox, Mozilla, Netscape 6 and higher).
</LI>
<LI>

Yes, with Gecko browsers. Internet Explorer on the Mac is <b>not</b> supported
even in the legacy mode. 
</LI>
<LI>
<B>What are the minimal system requirements</B><BR>
32 MB RAM, Windows 95, Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01.

<B>Clicking on the <A HREF=
"http://<?echo getenv("HTTP_HOST");?><?require(getenv("DOCUMENT_ROOT"). "/scripts/java/servlet_home");?>/familyMap?login=tyoma&key=1">
<IMG SRC='../img/KEY.gif'></A> button makes the new family map open in the 
same window. When I return to the previous screen, I see that all branches are closed. Is it possible to have several windows open 
at the same time?</B><BR>
Absolutely! <A HREF=
"http://<?echo getenv("HTTP_HOST");?><?require(getenv("DOCUMENT_ROOT"). "/scripts/java/servlet_home");?>/familyMap?login=tyoma&key=1">
<IMG SRC='../img/KEY.gif'></A>
 button is a regular HTML link. Click on it with the 
RIGHT mouse button and select "Open in new window".

<B>Why do segments of the Family Map overlap? What can I do about it?</B><BR>
Well, the Family Map is quite different from geografic maps. Genealogical map is a particular case of a topological maps - the
mathematical term for all sorts of maps. It is theoretically impossible to show all the information for all people without 
lines intersecting and nodes overlapping. You can space nodes apart, use a complicated routes from points A to points B (like
on electrical schemes), and use all other sorts of tricks. However, you have to stop at some point, because even if something
can be presented, it does not mean it can be undestood from such a scheme. Family Map Viewer is desinged in such way that a
relation between any two relatives, no matter how complicated, can be presented on one screen without overlapping nodes and 
intersecting lines. You can often show more, but not always. If you want to explore the relations of one particular person in 
more detail, just click on  <IMG SRC='/scripts/family/KEY.gif'></A> button to re-build the map around him or her.

<LI>
<B>If I close some branch, will all sub-branches close as well?</B><BR>
No. Closing a branch does not close sub-branches. Reopening the branch at a later time will retun the branch to the state
identical to that just before closing.
</LI>
<LI>
<B>Some relations are not specified. Why not?</B><BR>
Simply because we did not think they were important. Please send an e-mail to 
<A HREF="mailto:tyoma@tyoma.com">tyoma@tyoma.com</A> with the name of the relation, for example 
"greatgrandstepfather" and explain what it means in simple words, and we will be happy to add it to the relation detection 
subroutine. Thank you!

<B>Is my data private?</B><BR>
You have control over the privacy of your Family Map. If you decide not to share the Family Map name with anybody, it is all 
yours. If you do - it is up to you. Tyoma.com does not take any initiative in sharing your data, so please provide you visitors
 with a correct URL or at least the FamilyMap name.

<B>I uploaded the GED file into your server. Can I or someone else download the original data from the server?</B><BR>
No, you cannot. The original data you downloaded is stored in some secure location outside our web server. You do not need to have your
data back, because you keep the original. Your visitors do not need the original, because they get a nice Viewer from us.
</LI>
<LI>

Basically, to be able to delete your data from our server.
</LI>
<LI>
<B>I don't want to delete my data, I want to update them, what shall I do?</B><BR>
Upload your new data with the same login and password, new data file will replace
the old data set.

<LI>
<B>Help, I forgot my password!</B><BR>
Send an e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:tyoma@tyoma.com">tyoma@tyoma.com</A> with some description of
what your password looks like. We will manually delete your data. <BR>
Some advice:
<UL>
<LI>Do not give your ATM card PIN code as a password, just to be safe. </LI>
<LI>Keep it simple and easy to remember, because that password is not as important as your financial passwords. </LI>
<LI>Do not oversimplify your login name - if you are George, you do not want to
see some other George's Family Map. </LI>
