<h3>General description</h3> 

Some people asked me how it works and what technologies were used:
<OL>
<LI>The visitor creates the Genealogy information file (gedcom file) in <B>gedcom</B> standard. It it a plain text file that
can be viewed by a regular word processor. 
</LI>
The upload page uses INPUT TYPE="file" <B>HTML</B> tag to upload data into the server, which is <B>Apache</B> 
running under the <B>Linux (Debian)</B>.
<LI>The administative interface is performed in <B>PHP</B>.
</LI>
<LI>
The <B>JavaServlet</B> runs under <B>Tomcat</B> parse gedcom file and output 
<B>XML</B> file goes directly to the visitor's browser. You can see the data
 in XML data by View Source command.
<LI>
The XML transformed into the viewable format by <B>XSLT</B>, which also gets uploaded into a visitor's browser. Unlike an XML file with
 data, which is re-generated whenever you decide to change the "key" person, an XSLT file is static.  
</LI>
<LI>
In the legacy mode the XSLT transformation is done on the server using 
Apache <b>Xalan/Xerces</b> libraries. 
</LI>
<LI>
Sizes, colors, location of nodes, etc. are defined through <B>CSS</B> (Cascading Style Sheets)
</LI>
<LI>
Interactivity, i.e. openning - closing branches is handled on the client's side using <B>JavaScript</B>, which is sometimes
called <B>DHTML</B>. After opening the page, you can explore the whole Family Map off-line. 
</LI>
</OL>
<h3>Downloads and contributions</h3>
<p>You do not have to download and install Family Map Viewer, because the service is 
freely avaliable at <a href="http://www.tyoma.com">www.tyoma.com</a> web site. 
If you see some disadvanatage or bugs in the program, it probably would be 
better if you report it to the author <a href="maito:tyoma@tyoma.com">
tyoma@tyoma.com</a> to correct running version. </p>
<p>
Author also is also greatlly apreshiate futher internationalization, adding 
more languages. If somebody is unhappy with the current skin, the contributions
of the additional skins would be greatlly apreciated.    
</p>
<p>In case you willing to contribute new skin or language set, it is still not 
needed to download and install software. You can simply save the XML file and 
related XSL, CSS and js files on your computer and pertform development 
using XSLT engine of your browser. After you done, mail new XSL/CSS to me and 
I will drop it into the server.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are really would like to run your own Family Map Viewer on
your domain, or made serious contribution to the Java code, here is the source:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../source/familyMap.zip">web server part</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../source/familyMap.jar">Java part</a>
</li>
</ul>
</p> 
<h3>Instalation notes</h3> 
<ol>
<li>
Unzip familyMap.zip into the document root of your Apache server
</li>
<li>
Deploy familyMap.jar into Tomcat server.
</li>
<li>
Under application directory create the subdirectory named <u>data</u> and assign permisions 
777 to it. The directory <u>data</u> should be on the same level as WEB-INF 
directory.
</li>
<li>
Adjust path to the <u>data</u> directory within php elements, located at familyMap/php
directory. On my system it is <u>/usr/java/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/data</u>. 
The element names are <u>upload.php</u> and <u>delete.php</u>  
</li>
<li>
Adjust URL to the servlet in <u>view.php</u> element. On my system it is 
<u>/servlet/familyMap</u>.   
</li>
<li>
On my server, html pages are considered to be a PHP templates. If you restrict
PHP only to pages with .php extenshion, you will have to rename files in 
the familyMap/html directory, as a well as adjust links.
</li>
