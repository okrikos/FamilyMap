Just a few words before we start.<P>
Family Map is a free service by tyoma.com that provides you with an oportunity to share your genealogical information with 
your relatives and friends. Unlike most of the family tree viewers, the presented map allows to show all relatives, including in-laws and 
steps. Since such maps can get very large, you have a freedom to view a particular map fragment that your are interest in. For example, 
I can show my relation to my step-grand-father-in-law and people through whom this relation is formed 
(my wife, mother-in-law, mother-in-law's second husband, his father). <P>
